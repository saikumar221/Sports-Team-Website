          The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested during March or
          April
          and May of every year by eight teams representing eight different cities in India. The league was founded by
          the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2008. The IPL has an exclusive window in ICC Future Tours
          Programme.
          The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 ranked sixth by average attendance among
          all
          sports leagues. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast live on
          YouTube. The brand value of the IPL in 2019 was ₹475 billion (US$6.7 billion), according to Duff &
          Phelps. According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹11.5 billion (US$160 million) to the GDP of the
          Indian economy.

          There have been twelve seasons of the IPL tournament.
          SunRisers Hyderabad (often abbreviated as SRH) are a franchise cricket team based in Hyderabad, Telangana,
          India,
          that plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL). The franchise is owned by Kalanithi Maran of the Sun TV Network
          and was founded in 2012 after the Hyderabad-based Deccan Chargers were terminated by the IPL. The team is
          currently captained by David Warner and coached by Trevor Bayliss. The primary homeground of the team is the
          Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, Hyderabad with a capacity of 55,000.

          The brand value of the SunRisers Hyderabad was estimated to be ₹483 crore (US$68 million) in 2019 as the
          overall
          brand of IPL was increased to ₹47,000 crore (US$6.6 billion), according to Duff & Phelps.

          The team made their first IPL appearance in 2013, where they reached the playoffs, eventually finishing in
          fourth
          place. The SunRisers won their maiden IPL title in the 2016 season, defeating Royal Challengers Bangalore by 8
          runs in the final. The team has qualified for the play-off stage of the tournament in every season since 2016.
          In
          2018, the team reached the finals of the Indian Premier League, but lost to Chennai Super Kings by 8 Wickets,
          following a century by Shane Watson. The team is considered one of the best bowling sides, often admired for
          its
          ability to defend low totals. David Warner is the leading run scorer for the side, having won the Orange Cap 3
          times, in 2015, 2017, and 2019. Bhuvneshwar Kumar is the leading wicket-taker. List of captains of Sunrisers
